# Panorama-Image-Stitching

## Objective

This project imports a set of images and stitches each image together to create a panorama.  

## Program

The programs are developed in C++ (C++ 14) and Python (3.9.18).

The C++ code comprises files for class panorama and the main program. The C++ code utilized the built-in OpenCV image stitching algorithm, which can accept an input of two or more images from the dataset. 

The Python code contains the panorama class and stitch, the main program. The algorithms here can only accept two images as inputs. 

## Data

You can create your own dataset or go to this link for examples, https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/tree/4.x/testdata/stitching
